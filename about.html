      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <h3>What is virtual photography?</h3>

      <p>Virtual photography is just like real life photography - except you are taking the photo inside a game. Don't like the position of the sun? Maybe you were hoping for rain? You can change that! In the best of photomodes you can manipulate your characters pose and facial expressions. In some ways virtual photography is easier than real life photography. Truely you're only limited by your imagination (and sometimes the photomode). The challenge to virtual photography is you have the same tools as everyone else. Their camera is the same as yours. You're photographing the same game and sometimes the same scenes. So how do you stand out amongst millions of other players? Your individuality as a person is your best tool in virtual photography. Use your unique perspective and tastes to turn your photos into something special and fresh.</p>

      <h3>Who am I?</h3>

      <p>My name is Sara Atwood and I'm a Playstation based Virtual Photographer (Screen Capture Artist if you're fancy). I have been an artist all my life. While I do have college level photography education and am more than capable of producing VP that feels just like a real photo, my true passion is producing VP inspired by paintings. I love the softness and freedom of paint on canvas. The juxtaposition of a modern technology like virtual photography against old world paintings brings a totally new perspective to VP. I offer a fresh, yet classic, take on virtual photography. With a great photomode anyone can produce a sharp and saturated photo. What I offer to you is an artists eye. My photos feel soft, expansive, and like true works of art. I would love to bring my individuality to your game.</p>
